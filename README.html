The XPRA service runs and can be connected to, but trying to access the desktop via the notebook proxy/10001/ (trailing slash required for style) 
throws up the XPRA HTML client with an error.

For example, with notebook on 8877 and xpra on 10000, trying http://localhost:8877/proxy/10000/ gives:

```
You were disconnected for the following reason:

Did not receive hello before timeout reached, not an Xpra server?
```

and hands off to: http://localhost:8877/proxy/10000/connect.html

So the jupyter proxy is getting in the way somewhere?

Open directly onto `robotlab` and `neural` apps, although `neural` raises (screen?) memory issues?

`docker run -p 8877:8888 -p 10005:10000 -p 10006:10001 -d --name testxpraj  xpra-j`
